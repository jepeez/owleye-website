emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");

// Line 152: Replace with your actual service and template IDs
emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams)
```

### Example Configuration:

```

3. Check EmailJS dashboard for delivery status

## Free Tier Limits:
- 200 emails per month

## Alternative: Formspree
If you prefer a different service, you can also use Formspree:
1. Go to [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)
2. Create an account and get a form endpoint
3. Replace the EmailJS code with a simple form POST to Formspree

## Security Note:
Your EmailJS public key will be visible in the website code. This is normal and safe - EmailJS public keys are designed to be public. The service prevents spam through rate limiting and other security measures.
